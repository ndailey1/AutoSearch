Python script to automate mortgage release searches on a municipal database (recordhub) using Selenium to interact with the site. It reads a CSV file containing Volume and Page numbers, logs into the site with provided credentials, and searches for each Volume/Page pair under the "Book/Page" search option. For each search, it checks for related release documents (indicated by 'REL'), extracts details like Date Filed, Volume, and Page, and stores them in a pandas DataFrame along with the original mortgage Volume and Page. If a release is found, it adds the document to a cart for printing; if no release is found or an error occurs, it logs "No Release" with relevant details. The results are saved to a CSV file named 'ReleaseData.csv', and the browser is closed after each row is processed. Sample data comes from Winchester, CT land records.
